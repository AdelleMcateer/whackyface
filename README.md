# Overview 
A dynamic animation with user interaction in Processing (Java).
This is my very first program and use of Java.

## Description

The animation is a face with features that respond to mouse events and movements
It also takes a value from the user to generate an output.

I have created the animation by using selection, iteration, string methods, 
processing methods and a number of bespoke methods. 

Upon running the sketch please enter your name in the dialog box that appears. 
Then move, drag and press the mouse to generate the animated effects.
